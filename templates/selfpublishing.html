<blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">
    Step One: Gathered the final version of the written material.</h4>
        <p>This guide is not intended to help you write your novel. When you finally decide to self-publish, you might have pieces of your novel spread around in different notebooks, or complete and professionally edited. The first step is to take the entirety of your book and allow it to all come together. The mental part of this step is important, because you won't be allowed to edit the book in future steps. Make sure you're ready, and when you do, take the plunge to get your book published. Writing and publishing are two separate arts, and it helps to let the novel that will never be finished in your eyes be published properly.
        </p><p>At this point, you must type out any hand-written parts. If you have your novel spread across multiple files on a computer, you'll have to meld them into the proper order. None of the file formatting matters, therefore it can be helpful to use a simple text file. Or, if you need extras like bold and italic, a rich text file (.rtf) may be required. All of the future steps need a digital version of your entire book in a single file.
        </p><p>When you have everything that goes into the entire contents of your book, you're ready to move on to step two, and only then. The process to becoming self-published is fairly straightforward, and it helps to tackle it one step at a time. That way, you won't be constantly changing certain parts of your book when you know that after following each step, that portion of the self publishing should be final.
</p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">
    Step Two: Developed the front and end matter for the book, as well as chapter titles, and appropriate page headings and footers.
</h4><p>This necessary step will facilitate future steps. All books have a copyright page, publishing information, table of contents, and/or other things at the beginning of the book. This is called front matter. You can research online to find out exactly what this will entail. Added to this step is the chapter titles, because you might not have decided upon them in step one if your novel was scattered among different sources. You'll also want to decide on your headings. In general, novels won't have a header, but some other types of books do. You'll also need to choose a footer, usually page number.
        </p><p>In the back of the book could be any number of things, from an author page to an index. In this step, you'll get all the extra content of your book out of the way so you're not focused on the text of the book in later steps. This is the part where you start to form the important parts of your book that it will share will all books in a similar category.
        </p><p>For the table of contents, you'll likely need chapter headings. If your novel has proper headings, you will be able to automatically generate a table of contents and customize it in your word processor. When you decide on an e-book or a print book, you'll use the headings to organize your book further. E-books have a digital bookmarking system for skipping to chapter beginnings of your book. Make sure the text part of this is finalized before moving to the next step. If you want to make it easier for yourself later, you'll go ahead and configure the proper heading styles for your entire book.
</p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">
Step Three: Found a self-publishing platform that suited us.
        </h4><p>Print-on-demand services are plentiful. I know of at least two: Createspace and Lulu.com. If you're wanting to put your book on an online bookshelf right away, choose Createspace, for it is owned by Amazon, the premier marketplace for self-published books. Lulu.com might be a better choice if you're wanting to sell copies yourself. Lulu.com also has an online bookstore, but I don't recommend it if you want a large number of sales.
        </p><p>Also take into consideration the cost of each size of book if you're looking for print books. Of course, the size and style of your book will affect cost. You can often calculate the cost of a book for any number of pages before you even create the file for your book online.
        </p><p>E-book retailers and distributors are common. I can think of two that stand out, besides Createspace and Lulu.com, which are Smashwords and Google Books. The platform will also affect the market that will be able to acquire your book, based on location. Some platforms have worldwide distribution, and some may be more limited. It's up to you, but it's good to have a specific idea of which platform you'll use before moving on.
</p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">

Step Four: Divided the book into into a printed version and/or e-book, while gathering a single file for each.
</h4><p>It must be necessary to have a solid idea of whether you'll be publishing a printed book, an e-booth, or both before the next step. When you decide, take into mind the audience you plan to sell your book. E-book markets are extremely large, and it may take huge amounts of time to reach a viable sales market. Print-on-demand books have an even smaller market, but you may be wanting to add a print book to the e-book sales. Or, for whatever reason, you may just want a printed book.
        </p><p>When you will be submitting files to your self-publishing platform like Lulu.com, you may be submitting a .pdf, a .docx, or any number of different formats to be printed onto the page. In order for the page to look like you want, you'll be adjusting the margins for the file. Sometimes, you'll subtract a number of points from one side of the page. You may be required to alternate per page formatting, which is made quick by modifying page styles. All of this is possible with a modern word processor like Word or Libre Office.
        </p><p>E-books can be .html files or other formats. You may also submit a final e-book format file like .mobi to the self-publishing platform. In order for the file to be accepted by file-scanners in the submission site, the bookmarking system for chapters must be exactly formatted according to their rules. This can be for the automatically generated table of contents used for e-books.
        </p><p>Gathering a single file is important for the website you choose to upload it to. ISBN numbers will change for e-books and printed books, so there will definitely be a separate file to be worked on in the website's software. All of the page heading and chapter titles will come in handy when finishing the final formatting for either book.
</p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">

    Step Five: Created or commissioned a cover for the book.</h4>
<p>If you can't afford five dollars to commission a cover, I heartily recommend trying to create your own. It can be simple with a program like GIMP for Linux and Windows to create such an image. The art you make can also be drawn with tablets, or made from certain images you find online. You can pay for stock images, or try some free ones to add to your book cover. Many times, this is exactly what professionals do when they commission you a cover. You will only find your unique cover through a little bit of work, which will be made in this step.
</p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">Step Six: Performed file changes required by the platform we chose.
</h4><p>Take a second look at your files created for the publishing software you'll be uploading it to. Do they match all the requirements for your final book product? You might want to add a cover to the file itself, for e-books. Or you may need an author page for the final page. Not to mention, the requirements for the pages might be out of whack. The software may not even accept your file. Whatever you need to do, make your final changes now. You'll pay for any mistakes in the long run.
        </p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">Step Seven: Ordered and reviewed a proof copy of the book.
</h4><p>A proof copy is used to check for any mistakes in the printing or publishing process that got out of whack in the time between uploading the files and receiving the final product. You can even do this for e-books, but usually proof copies are only considered necessary for the printed version. It's used to check for cover errors, interior problems, and can also be used to check for proofreading errors in the final copy.
        </p><p>The cost of the printed book will be very cheap for you, as the author. It will not be marked up to the final price you sell it. A 200-page proof copy may cost around six dollars, depending on paper quality and color vs B&W. This price will be the final cost paid to the publishing website, in addition to the cost you add to earn profits for yourself. It can be wise to check the prices to make sure they're not out-of-range for what you want to mark the book up, and earn.
        </p><p>You might want to order multiple proofs if you find errors in the first copy. The cost won't be very much in many cases, and the overall cost of having mistakes in the published novel will be worth an extra proof, or two. Once you've found the final version of your book, move on to the next step, registering the book's ISBN number.
    </p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">Step Eight: Registered the book's ISBN number.
</h4><p>There's a reason you do this nearly last. The ISBN number might be free, but it can cost in some cases. The important part to know is that you can't make major changes to your book without a new ISBN number. You can't change the title or the author, as well. The e-book will need a separate ISBN as the printed version. The website will probably adequately explain most of this for registering your free ISBN. If you buy ISBN in sequential numbers, you'll probably have to pay. You can buy ISBN's in bulk.
        </p><p>Register your ISBN just before you get the final copy of your book uploaded to your publishing platform. If you wait, you won't be making any major changes, which won't require a new ISBN. Then, market your novel or book. You're done!
        </p></blockquote><blockquote><h4 class="yellow-text">Step Nine: Continued to market the book.
        </h4><p>Once you put the book to sale, a minor step not included in this handy guide, you'll be marketing the book just as much as you were before. That is to say, in many cases, none. You'll have to start the long process in the galaxy of books online into paving the way into a voice for yourself. Good luck, and don't forget it was self-publishing that got you here.
