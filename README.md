Become a tester.

WE NEED WRITING SOFTWARE TESTERS!
Your focus as tester will be. . .

Design and look of a literature weblog being built on the advanced Google Cloud platform
Perfecting ease of use of new features, for young (5th-12th grade) writers
Safety awareness in design to prevent privacy breaches, adult content, and menacing user behavior
Contribute your new feature ideas and we might implement them
Help our website growth online, until we have regular users that enjoy its services
Engineering future social networks to be more wonderful through design and planning
Providing feedback on the direction the website takes over time as it's developed
Copypasta Publishing is currently an indie book publisher, while the new website will be property underneath it. What's exciting is that a unique name for the social media website will need to be chosen by testers. I want to include you in developing the marketing strategy and overall design and features of the weblogging site. I want Copypasta partners to help me decide on branding materials, unlike how I designed Caesar Naples Wiki with no collaboration at all.

Opportunity is now. I want to ask if you'll give your friends a similar appeal to mine, asking them to help me make writing software for modern social media blogging. I can write new testers a contract, so when I reach a milestone in progress they complete a new survey. I'm planning on paying testers $10 for every survey they fill out for me, if they provide feedback on the website and its look and feel. They will give their opinions about new features.
