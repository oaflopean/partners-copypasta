    c2.content =u'<html><body><h1>DREAMS OF MORPHEUS </h1><p>Thoughts emanating through my mind. Words fly high above my head. They chirp and trill like colourful hummingbirds in the summer sun. I invite them to perch upon my hand so that I may see them better and divine a description; a recipe to explain to humankind, those elusive but intoxicating utterings of the gods. Somehow these hummingbirds remain evanescent, just beyond the tip of my brain; fluttering, beautiful, glowing with otherworldly warmth of the god that created them. I feel their power, pure energy encased in a colourful shell that defines shape and form. I observe the gentle appearance of the word-hummingbird in my hand, I feel it\'s latent power pulsating with a dull resonance that courses through my body. Inspired, I capture the essence of this beautiful creature; a photograph in my mind that connects my soul to the mind of a god who created this hummingbird. I sit back slowly enjoying the connection, his strength fills my brain with ideas so beautiful, alongside strange conceptions of terror and torment. A wonderful dichotomy of pleasure, fear and pain; I yearn to gather more word-hummingbirds. I must find a way to communicate the divine from my mind, to my world. </p><p>My friend and I over a bottle of wine, that divine gift of Bacchus to the mortal realms, found together we were soon able to define those elusive musings into a tapestry of word-hummingbirds. And so, as in Ancient Greece, we became an \'oracle\'of the gods. Now I feel the gentle \'whisperings\' tip-tapping at my soul.  The word-hummingbirds form together into tales and stories so perfect I\'m brimming with ecstasy. As the stories flow into my mind\'s reservoir, the god quietly introduces himself; he is the immortal god of sleep and dreams, Morpheus. </p><p>My friend and I have often spoken collectively about the \'dreams of Morpheus\' and so have brought these magical tales together; as a modern \'Oracle\' we unite these wondrous thoughts and ideas for you. Some bring joy, some dread and fear. None will leave you the same. These tales may be enjoyed anywhere, at any time. Perhaps you too are toasting Bacchus, or you might be preparing to meet Morpheus through the divine medium of \'sleep\'. Remember do not read these words lightly, for beware, \'those whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad\'. </p><h3>Paul Harris and M.J. Hewitt<br>January 2019 </h3></body></html>'

    c3 = epub.EpubHtml(title='ACORN\'S SPAWN', file_name='acornsspawn.xhtml', lang='en')
    c3.content =u"<html><bopy><h1>ACORN'S SPAWN</h1><p>The crooked hunched up old man staggered towards the entrance of the cave, an arduous task for a man of such age and fragility. It was very true that his days of youth were well past, but he could still feel the heat of a raging fire that burnt brightly and painfully within his ancient heart. A fire that could never be dampened, a fire that had now spread to his mind, setting it alight with a curiosity of what lay ahead. Oh the wonderful anticipation of youth and power was intoxicating. He felt light headed as he stood at the cave entrance, it smelt dank, and a heavy earthy smell filled his nostrils forcing him to gag. There was something else, he sensed something ancient and malevolent inside. Is this it? Is it really here? He thought to himself as a sinister smile spread across his dry lips. His heart swelled with excitement. \"I must be careful\", he said under his breath failure would seal his fate to eternal torment. Gingerly he entered, a mixture of excitement and fear bubbling within him, he began chanting loudly in an ancient tongue un-uttered for a millennia, hoping with all his heart that at last he could recapture something that he had dreamed of since he had been a child. He was prepared to risk his life for a taste of being adored and worshipped like the god he saw himself as truly being.</p><p>As his mantra echoed around the cave, the heaviness lifted slightly as if the very atmosphere was listening to his words, then suddenly it returned with an explosion, pinning him painfully to the floor of the cave. He raised his voice again guttural chants imperiously resonating within the darkness, a mixture of anger and trepidation filled his soul. He scrabbled around on the dirty floor, trying to lift his feeble body. Trying to summon up the strength to climb to his feet, but the sheer force of the explosion had virtually drained him of all his remaining strength. Instead though, he managed to use his feet to slowly push himself backwards, so that after a hugely strenuous effort his back was now propped up against the damp cave wall.</p><p>The great force that lay in the darkness before him had grown silent, but he could still sense its brooding presence. So once again he raised his voice, but louder this time, as his eyes rolled to the back of his head he chanted some of the most ancient magical words he could remember. Within an instant there was a further explosion, which literally shook the walls and bright streams of light poured forth in waves, pulsating with a strength he had never seen before, the old man had to cover his eyes due to the incredible power of the light. He gasped involuntarily as the magnitude of the situation tore at his soul with clawed barbs. After a few moments silence reigned, but the bright pulsing light continued, his head throbbed with the deafening silence surrounding him.</p><p>He slowly regained his composure as tentatively he peered through his laced fingers at the wall of the cave that lay directly in front him, and was stunned by the precise writings which covered the surface.</p><p>They were ancient runes, words that filled his mind, and deafened his senses; he rubbed his eyes in disbelief as the words and sentences unfolded on the cave wall before him. </p><p>\"Saviour, our Saviour Baliel. We have waited so long, so long!  At last you have come to reunite us, set us free. Make us strong again Anointed One! Make us strong! The evil one  separated us, weakened us, tormented and drained us of all our greatness. And now we are imprisoned, I within this suffocating earth, and my brother within the depths of the molten fire which everlastingly burns. Bring us together, so that we are the Angel of Death once again and eternal greatness and immortality will be yours, powerful Master! Release me now O'Great One and I will grant you the sweetness of immortality, release my brother from the pit of fire and you will be granted what you seek. You will be a god! We will make you all powerful, feared, adored and worshipped oh great and glorious Master!\"</p><p>Suddenly silence and darkness reigned once more throughout the cave; the old man slowly slid his trembling, grimy fingers from his eyes.  He could see nothing apart from the pale light from the cave entrance. He crawled forwards his mind in turmoil due to the enormity of the information he had received but which had been shut off in an instant as the darkness had abruptly returned to the cave. Eventually he reached the far wall of the cave where he thought the written words had been etched. But to his disbelief the wall felt smooth under his fingertips. He moved his open palms up and down the rock searching for the words, searching for the next clue which would help him on his journey towards immortality and greatness. He was getting desperate. </p><p>Hot tears of defeat were trickling from Baliel's eyes when a  rumbling sound came from the darkness deep below the cave. He stopped abruptly, letting his body slide down the cave wall, he rested on his haunches, slowly curling himself into a foetal ball in fear of this new sound which was rapidly getting closer and closer to him. He peered into the darkness and his weary eyes suddenly picked out a vast shape travelling low across the cave floor.  It glowed a pure white in the darkness, it seemed to be shining from the inside out, it was its sheer length that stunned him as he still could not see the end of its snake-like body as it moved rapidly over the rocks. </p><p>His body was frozen with fear, he could not manage any movement as his heart banged within his feeble body, and he felt that his heart would surely explode as the abomination came to a sudden halt in front of his curled up form. His eyes widened in terror at the sight of serpent's tongue which was as long on its own as any ordinary snake, it flicked in and out of its hideous jaw. The old man was shaking as the serpent's hot breath blasted into his face, a stench worse than rotting flesh knotted his stomach. It was breathing hard as soft words began to emanate from somewhere deep down within its body. \"My Lord, my Lord, listen\". \"Be calm now for I am your guide, I am Hydra and I wish to deliver you to the light my Lord\". The old man pushed himself back further into the unyielding cave wall. \"Be calm, I wish to lead you to the light, take my hand\".  Slowly the serpent's huge jaw opened and a small pale arm appeared; the hand with delicate fingers beckoning to the old man, reaching for him with an open palm. The old man suddenly felt a calmness flow through his body, as the small hand waved within the darkness before him, I am surely under a spell he thought to himself in his befuddled mind as he reached out towards the hand. He slowly entered into the serpent's mouth. Crawling into the bright light that glowed from within. He peered up into the eyes of a strange creature that now held him in a strong embrace and was struck by the orange glow in its slit eyes. It's face and body were that of a pure opaque white and only the top half of it's body moved freely as the bottom half was welded, like a thick fleshy branch to the innards of the serpent. In fact he recognised that it was one with the serpent. \"We travel, sleep O' Lord as a long perilous journey lies before you\", the creature hissed. And in a drugged state the old man slumped into a deep sleep.   </p><p><hr></p><p>Hydra travelled rapidly, deeper and deeper into the bowels of the earth, passing many abominations and peculiar sights that human eyes would never see or understand, until eventually coming to rest in a clearing which pulsed with incredibly bright bursts of light. Once Hydra had come to rest, its inner-self gently reached over with one of its small hands, touching softly the closed eyelids of the old man. And in an instant his eyes opened. And once again he felt an incredible calmness sweep through him as the slitted eyes of the creature met his. He felt a connection, a tugging deep in his mind when thoughts as strong as spoken words began to materialise within his mind. \"Here is the light my Lord, go to the light, free it from its imprisonment as the first part of your quest. Go now and be strong.\"</p><p>With the words of Hydra still resonating within his brain the old man crawled out from the mouth of the serpent. Flashes of light becoming even more intense, as he crawled forth. He slithered on his belly with a new-found skill, he moved with ease on his belly into the clearing where the light pulsed so brightly.  Resting before him in the centre of the clearing was the source of the light, oval in shape, flashing with waves of bright light that seemed to oscillate, circulating and sloshing around within the egg like shape.  Still feeling calm he slid and crawled towards it, loosening his dagger within its scabbard.  He felt no fear, only determination and calmness as the hissing words of Hydra once again became loud and clear within his essence. </p><p>\"Rise up my Lord, pierce the skin, release the light and immortality will be yours!\" With these last words, Baliel hurled himself towards the oval shape, slashing at its walls with his dagger.  </p><p>An enormous eruption of sound and glowing whiteness poured forth from the egg, waves and waves of tiny skittering spider-like insects fell upon him, lifting him up like a rag doll on a wave of whiteness, tossing him around the cave.  Shrieking sounds emanating from his lips, as if the very demons of hell had been released, echoed back and forth bouncing off the cave walls as the ground rumbled and cracked, huge ragged fissures appearing throughout the cave.  The small glowing insects entered him in waves tearing at his flesh painfully, gushing through his every orifice pinning him to the floor of the cave as they became one with him.</p><p>He felt a new strength.  His whole body, even though aged throbbed with a new inner strength.  Immortality at last was his and he whooped and cackled with laughter that echoed back and forth around the cave.  He could feel the small insects that had entered his body skittering around within him, up and down the insides of his throat and around his stomach and guts. He liked the feeling; it was warm and filled him with happiness.  He knew that the insects possessed a power far greater than any he could ever possess and he also knew that this was truly his first step towards greatness as a piece of the great Angel of Death now held sanctuary within him. He felt clear headed, no longer angry, he knew what he had to do and how to do it. It was going to be a challenge, but for a man of his power it was definitely achievable.  He remembered the etchings upon the cave wall and realised to himself that now he must journey much deeper into the very molten centre of the earth to find the final part of the Angel of Death. Half of the Angel was now within him, so surely the tasks that lay in front of him would be much easier to achieve.  He had immortality and he was hungry to be acclaimed as a god.  But he would only be granted divinity once he had managed to reunite both pieces of the Angel of Death.  Baliel sat in the darkness and waited. He had no idea how long he had been in this same spot and to be honest it really didn't matter.  All that mattered to Baliel was awareness, awareness of a sign.  Any sign which could lead him onto the next part of his journey.  He now possessed a new found patience, and he was happy to wait. </p><p><hr></p><p>No one but Baliel knew of what he had witnessed as a child. Scenes that were etched upon his mind ultimately led him on this journey towards immortality and divinity. No one knew of his secret.    </p><p>Baliel as a child, was of the inquisitive kind.  So much so that he would often sit alone for what seemed like hours  within the gloomy  woods, listening to the birds, listening hard for any sound that could heighten his childish curiosity.   On this particular spring morning Baliel was sat in his favourite spot in a small clearing, perched on the gnarled roots of a  locally famous oak tree. The tree was famous in the small village that Baliel grew up in, a fame shrouded in mystery and gloom.  The story of the 'tree' was read to  the children of the village when they had misbehaved as a kind of  punishment, it was known in the story as the 'child-eating tree'.    All the story did to Baliel was make him even more curious.  It was said that when a child disobeyed or misbehaved towards his or her parents that the roots of the child-eating tree would seek out the child, firstly strangling and then dragging them under the ground, where eventually they would be deposited into their final resting place deep within the dark hollow of the tree for all eternity.   </p><p>This particular morning Baliel for around the fiftieth time was running through this same story of the tree in his own mind, searching for a shred of fear to assist him out of his boredom, when he was pulled  out of his thoughts by what sounded like the muffled cries of a child.  Baliel realises to his disbelief that a child's whimpering was emanating from the trunk of the tree itself.  With his whole body shivering from a mixture of fear and excitement coursing through his body, he tottered over to the trunk of the tree known as the 'child-eating tree'.  He gingerly placed his ear against the rough bark, pressing hard against it.  As soon as his ear touched the tree, Baliel felt a peculiar dizziness and in an instant became completely unconscious.   When he came back to his senses  he found himself surrounded by heaps of lifeless children.  Stacked high, laid in lines, pale, lifeless and completely silent.    </p><p><hr></p><p>Totally dismayed by his situation Baliel suddenly realised that he was now within the tree itself.  But how could this be? A world lying within a tree?  Still in shock he staggered to his feet and recognised that the children were laid out in shapes.  A line of children before him was laid out in the shape of a pale fleshy shaped arrow.  And then a long line of children that reminded him of a trail of breadcrumbs went well off into the distance and up towards a small tower perched darkly on the very top of a hill of smooth, shining  oakwood.    Something drew Baliel towards this strange tower and he scurried forth.</p><p>Not so scared but more excited, Baliel arrived at the front door of the tower.  Baliel gently pushed against the large door and it  creaked open, a stench wafted over Baliel from the inside.  Tentatively he moved into a large room with immense arched ceilings.  A wide open room lay before him and in the centre lay an immense oblong shaped table gleaming brightly of what appeared to be a white marble.  In the centre of the table lay a tiny child. The child was humming gently to itself as Baliel moved towards it. When Baliel had reached the side of the table he heard a scurrying from high above and to his horror he could now make out in the gloom many large dark stick-like insects writhing down the walls towards him.    A dark wave of strange slithering stick insects descended upon him paralysing his body with sticky venom which they squirted from all angles. </p><p>Baliel couldn't move, but he could still see and he could indeed comprehend a chattering emanating from these creatures; strangely enough it was a chattering he could understand, a dream like chanting, \"wait until your seventieth year, on your seventieth year you may become immortal and walk as a god upon this stinking earth, the child will awake and lead you to greatness. 'Acorn' will slowly awake within you and lead you to  the great one named the 'Angel of Death' where you will free him from his captivity. Your reward will be to become an  immortal  god! Listen, this must remain a secret or the weight of the world will fall upon thee!\" </p><p>The words and images of that strange day so long ago still moved through Baliel's mind, crystal clear.  At the time, Baliel thought it had all been a very odd, incredibly realistic dream, as the next thing he realised was that he was back at home tucked up in bed. But shortly afterwards as time drifted by, he began to hear a child's voice in his head, he realised then that something unexplainable had happened to him that day. The child announced itself as 'Acorn' and Baliel in an instant thought back to his strange experience within the child-eating tree, which he had initially dismissed as nothing more than a dream. As the years went by 'Acorn' spoke more often to Baliel reminding him to hold on to his secret.  'Acorn' would constantly remind Baliel that immortality and godship were worth waiting for and as his seventieth year was approaching Acorn began to provide him with more and more detail regarding his journey towards greatness. </p><p>Eventually Baliel's patience paid off, as once again he could  hear the shrill familiar voice of Acorn emerging from the depths of his psyche. The Angel of Death however, strangely fell silent within him. Baliel listened intently to the directions of Acorn as he rose from his sitting position and began to follow with an inhuman speed. Down into the bowels of the earth, with haste with high velocity he descended. Darkness and stifling heat surrounded him but he felt no fear, he felt no pain  from the increasing heat that enveloped him. This way, that way, left, right, the orders from Acorn poured forth from his psyche.   Until in a scream that reverberated around his head, Acorn shouted \"halt!\"At that precise moment a surge of excitement blasted through Baliel's body. \"At last I am here,\" he thought to himself, \"at last the final part of the jigsaw is within my grasp. I am moments from becoming a god amongst men!\" For the first time on this latest part of his journey, Baliel began to look around himself taking in the oddness of his new destination, for the rest of the journey had been nothing more than a blur as he had speeded towards this destination with an inhuman speed.  Baliel to his total disbelief was now standing in the centre of a very large well lit Great Hall.  Grand chandeliers hung down from the high ceilings, and paintings adorned the walls, paintings that each displayed a familiar image, they showed different  depictions of the great snake Hydra.   </p><p>Standing before him, less than twenty feet or so away from his gaping, shocked face stood a court jester, who silently juggled three swords. A smug expression decorated his cherub like face. A huge open fire raged directly behind him, casting whirling shadows around the walls and ceiling of the vast Hall. Open mouthed Baliel slowly moved toward the jester who continued with great speed and agility to juggle his three blades. \"Halt!\" Acorn screamed once again within the Psyche of Baliel. 'This is the final guard, the gatekeeper of the great magicians, defeat him and you will have finally reached the ultimate phase of the 'god-making' which rests within the deepest part of the very fire that rages before thee, but beware of the swords, for one of these was the very blade that cleaved into two pieces, the mighty Angel of Death. Magic pulses within them, you may be immortal, but these swords can destroy immortality.\"</p><p>More tentatively now, Baliel began to try to step around the jester whose expression remained totally unchanged; 'Let me pass' Baliel croaked.  The jester, as if not hearing, stared straight through Baliel with a fixed stare. To Baliel's frustration each time he tried to pass, the jester moved swiftly to block his path, the only sound being the razor sharp swords, whirring as they cut through the air.  After several unsuccessful attempts,  Baliel ground to a halt, for he could not think of anyway of bypassing the jester.  Then to his amazement he suddenly noticed a movement in the corner of his eye.  A movement within the paintings that adorned the walls of the Hall.  The paintings began to become more life-like, bubbling in their frames, stretching and forming into more solid structures.  The jester paid no attention to this phenomenon, only Baliel's eyes open-wide beheld the amazing changes taking place, as many small versions of the snake Hydra slithered ever so silently and gently down the walls, very alive now, paintings no more. Around the juggling jester's feet they gathered, his smug expression remaining unchanged as they tightened their grip around his legs.   Five of them in total slithered up the jester's body towards his unchanged cherub like face. </p><p>Recognising the opportunity unfolding before him, Baliel rapidly made a dash for the raging fire and in an instant he had successfully passed the jester, the only sight now was the flames, the only sound now was the blood-curdling scream and keening noise which echoed all around the Great Hall from behind him.  But about none of this he cared, as the images of himself being deified flooded his mind. Baliel in an instant leapt into the flames, eyes wide seeking out the final part of the Angel of Death which would bring him divinity.  Baliel waded forward the flames licking his body, embracing him from every angle. A cloak of fire forming around his body a crown of fire adorned his head. He never expected pain as he was aware that immortality was his and so when he witnessed his skin sliding from his body in a thick streaming, bubbling rivulets he firstly felt more shock than physical pain. But soon enough the pain engulfed him, a pain like no other tore through his frail body, \"but I am immortal!\", he screamed and howled as he fell to his knees within the inferno. </p><p><hr></p><p>Nothing now but a bubbling mess made up of a mixture of skin and charred bone remained of Baliel.  Strangely, however; movement came from the mound of flesh which was once the hunch that had weighed Baliel down for so many years. The hunch that had grown on Baliel's back over the years since his strange experience within the 'child-eating tree'.  \"Cut me free! Cut me free!\", the fleshy lump screamed.  </p><p>Beckoned by his master Hydra entered the pyre, bloodied from battle he slithered through the flames to the lump of flesh.  Once at the pulsing mound, Hydra opened his mouth revealing a small slender arm which held forth a bloodied magical dagger.  With a surgeon's skill Hydra began to slice into the fleshy mound. Within moments the one named 'Acorn' emerged. Wriggling firstly like a newborn he pushed his way through the remaining globules of fat and flesh.  </p><p>A  feeling of rebirth surged through Acorn, all these years waiting for his freedom, all these years of waiting to be in this special place. To be immortal to be a god. Now he was even more determined that the final stages of his journey would be completed.  </p><p>Vengeance! With the thought of vengeance Acorn began to salivate, drooling from his mouth the fires sizzling around him.  He now possessed immortality whilst his host of many years smouldered before him.  \"The gullible fool\", Acorn thought to himself, \"he has served his purpose, he has carried me to my destination.\" With this thought Acorn began to crawl through the flames, immortality as his shield.  </p><p>Being guided purely by instinct with Hydra by his side they eventually came upon a slight clearing in the fire.  In the centre of this clearing stood a burning tree.  A tree which was entirely made of fire, branches, trunk and leaves flickering orange and red, emitting a searing heat. High up and completely surrounded and protected by a blossom of gushing flame, hung two rosy red apples.   </p><p>Acorn knew that this was it, one of these apples was the final prison of the Angel of Death.  At last after such an arduous journey he had reached his destination and with passion and excitement he rushed towards the tree.   </p><p>But to his shock Hydra was much quicker, slithering up through the flames towards the crimson apples.   \"Traitor! How dare you betray me!\" Acorn screamed as Hydra the serpent quickly scaled the burning tree and rapidly gobbled down one of the apples and then waited anxiously and in anticipation for the effects of the apple to begin.  </p><p>Acorn stood for several seconds in shock, mouth wide open as Hydra waited to become god, \"that should be me\", Acorn thought gloomily to himself.  Then with a sudden burst of speed fuelled by rage, Acorn leapt through the flames and rapidly began to climb up and up to where Hydra lay upon the branches of fire, close to the still remaining apple.   </p><p>Virtually within touching distance of Hydra, Acorn came to an abrupt halt, for he became completely mesmerised by the sight that lay before him.  Hydra had begun to rapidly change colours, pink, green, orange, and with each change of colour a gasp from deep inside of Hydra burst forth.  Acorn could only think that Hydra was changing into the god he wanted to be and this was part of the process of change. </p><p>This thought was short lived as Acorn then noticed black liquid beginning to gush and splash from Hydra's mouth. Screams of agony also poured forth from Hydra as he began to thrash around furiously within the flames.  Acorn concluded that Hydra had eaten the wrong fruit and was now dying for his greed. </p><p>With this thought Acorn navigated around the riving body before him and scurried with the speed and agility of a squirrel out onto the branch which held the remaining apple.   Glee bubbled through his body as he reached out for the remaining apple but just as he was moving forward a small hand gripped vice like onto his neck holding him back, holding him tight.  Acorn choking struggled ferociously then fleetingly managed to catch sight of his adversary.  The remains of Hydra clung about him and the tree. Mainly only the insides of Hydra remained, comprising of a bloodied ribcage and one pale fleshy arm which ended in a small but devilishly strong pale hand, that was tightening its grip relentlessly around his neck.   </p><p>With his strength rapidly ebbing away, Acorn grasped for the remaining apple, biting into it, aided  by the very last remnants of his strength.   The very second that the flesh of the apple began to slither down his throat everything about him froze. Frozen in time, flames and smoke stilled, the fingers about his neck stilled.  The only item that did not freeze still was the slow progression of the small bitten off piece of apple travelling down his throat.  Strangely, as if this piece of apple had grown eyes or Acorn had actually manifested himself within it, Acorn could see every step of the journey down his own throat.   Down a dark passage way, twisting, turning and then suddenly bursting out into a vast space flooded with a pale light.  He lay there still for a moment regaining his senses and then realised that his last wish had come true. Around him on every side, stacked high lay pale lifeless children.  Piles upon piles of children torn from their wicked mothers and fathers for just being children, spirited children who were too young to know right from wrong. They had been strangled in their beds and dragged by merciless cursed roots and deposited into the bowels of the child-eating tree.  And here they rested for what was most definitely to be all eternity until the return of Acorn.  </p><p>The god Acorn had returned to free his comrades from their own personal prisons of death. With this thought still resonating around Acorns head, streams of tears began to pour from his bloodshot eyes. As if the darkest clouds had been torn asunder water pooled about Acorn and began to slowly rise and cover the lifeless corpses.  As the water began to soak into their skins one by one they began slowly to revive.  Shaking themselves, brushing their hands down their bodies, becoming aware that life was once again was back within them.      </p><p><hr></p><p>After several hours of endless tears flooding from Acorn, all the pale lifeless children had been brought back from the dead.  The final pools of water were now being lapped up by the children, feeding each other, cupping the water in their hands, pouring the essence of their lord down each others thirsty throats.  They were hungry now, not for food but for vengeance. For the scars still remained, psychologically and most definitely physically their eyes bulged, their tongues lolled from their mouths, their necks remained stretched, elongated and cruelly twisted, marked with an array of black bruises.  \"Vengeance!\" they screamed in unison, from out of  all manner of broken necks and throats. \"Vengeance!\"</p><p>As evening began to seep over the slumbering town, hordes of deformed children of all shapes and sizes led by Acorn descended upon the residents.  Slicing, cutting, gouging, blood in gallons soon flooded the streets.  Driven by an inhuman rage the children within hours massacred the entire town.  They brought it to its knees.  Curiously only the adults were slaughtered, all children were spared. </p><p>At around midnight of that same day wagons were readied, slowly and systematically being piled high with broken corpses of the entire adult population of the town.  As a punishment the children of the town who had shown some resistance in protecting the evil adults, were utilised as slaves and ordered by Acorn to wheel the heavily laden corpse wagons dripping with gore into the depths of the forest. </p><p>After several days of hard labor the entire population of adults lay slain and piled high within the tree famously known as the 'child-eating tree' and the town was now entirely populated by laughing, joyful children.</p><p>In time children filtered into the woods, where in unison they prayed, sang and wept around the great tree from which they had been reborn.  A tree that's branches were heavily laden with multitudes of swaying Acorns. </p></body></html>"

    c5.content =u"<html><body><h1>THE DARK SIDE OF ZENNADON</h1><p>The earth bleeds. Black water gushes from the mountains of madness. Filthy, stagnant water bursts from dark, deep internal cavities, like blood from a severed artery.</p><p>Abnormal, malformed, two-headed beasts, pure white, red-eyed, slimy animals of the night, they ride the flooding water. They skip across the galloping waves of putrid filth. They yelp excitedly like small babies. They scream through the sounds of the torrents of water that pound, down and down, from the deadly, nightmarish, craggy mountains of madness, for they know their journey is nearly complete.</p><p>Flooding over the ancient, gothic cemetery, graves are besieged and overrun by the web-footed, two-headed, red-eyed, demonic children of the grey, rugged, harsh-looking mountains that now loom far above.</p><p>The demonic horde delves and gives chase to tired, frightened spirits, who flee in terror from the beasts. Spirits are captured, attacked, and torn to pieces by the hungry, razor-sharp toothed, swimming animals. Some spirits are drowned. Others are tormented into madness and then hung high from the ancient trees, which stare upon this frightful scene.</p><p>The trees protest in unison for the spirits to be left alone, but the barbaric beasts just laugh and further insulting the trees by hanging the spirits higher from their branches like luminous banners, which flap and wave beneath the darkening, bloody skies; and so the trees now weep tears of sap, which slowly trickles down their rugged, outer skins and gathers in pools on their knotted roots.</p><p>Later now, as darkness reigns, fires can be seen burning across the rivers, which waters bubble. Banks of rising steam float gently upward, spread into and mix with the darkness to shroud far-flung lands and distant waters; and upon these banks, walk gloomy, downhearted spirits, weak and full of fright, lonely and silently searching for lost friends, who have been cast into oblivion by the demons of the mountains of madness, friends, who will forever wander on that arid land, which will always sleep, forever, on the black side of the fabled moon of Zennadon.</p><p>For this truly be hell.</p></body></html>"

    c6.content =u"<html><body><h1>ELDRED 1: SLYPH</h1><p>Standing upon the lush green slopes of the mountain of Zintai stood Prince Eldred. </p><p>Standing alone, his ice blue eyes were steadily fixed upon the bloody carnage taking place within the valley below. Today it was a valley of death, a valley which ran with rivers of crimson blood.</p><p>The Prince was dressed in armour which befitted his station, a lightweight armour that was more durable than any other in existence. It was trimmed with precious gold and enamelled across his chest in bright orange was the Eagle of Satori, his family crest of which he was so proud. </p><p>In his hand he held a sword of immense beauty. It had a handle of gold  finished with the head of a serpent at its hilt. A serpent which only he knew held a deadly surprise, for in the event of the Prince desiring it, he could open the serpent's mouth in an instant exposing two sharp fangs laced with poison that could render any assailant paralysed. This was not any ordinary poison for he had taken the precaution of giving it to his Father's magician Adjan. Adjan had spoken words of great magical power over the sword to ensure the poison would work on any person, mortal or immortal, human or demon.</p><p>The Princes' thoughts returned to the battle raging before him, his muscular body tightening, preparing for battle. As yet he had watched the battle from afar with his Father King Edwin and the other Lords but it was clear that soon he himself would be called to battle.  Scanning the distant horizon he could see the huge red star suspended above the majestic slopes of Zintai, flowing from it was a wave of enemy soldiers dressed in armour of blood red, he felt exhilarated. Whilst it would be the first time the Prince had gone into battle he was already a skilled fighter and was not unnerved by the sight of battle. He would soon have the honour of standing beside his father where they would defend the great Kingdom, fighting side by side.</p><p>Huge ravens hovered high above the scene, their orange eyes shining and glinting in the sunlight. Their powerful wings beating in a whirling frenzy as they swooped into battle themselves, pecking at the assailant's eyes with a fevered ferocity, for these were no ordinary birds of the sky, but ferocious hand reared pets the enemy's children.   The Prince quickly hated these flying beasts and couldn't wait to stamp the life out of their scrawny bodies. </p><p>Suddenly a great cry bellowed forth and a huge rumble ensued as the enemy readied themselves once again to advance, the birds perched on the soldier's shoulders twitching and fluttering in anticipation of a further thrust. Swords were drawn once again as the enemy began their fresh surge. </p><p>The forces of his father King Edwin moved forward to meet the menace before them, they were already battered and bloodied but resolutely stepped around severed heads and disfigured disembowelled corpses which were scattered around them, for the battle had already lasted several hours.</p><p>The King's eyes suddenly widened and shone with a blood lust as he turned to face his son. \"It is time; time to go down and deal the death blow to our enemy. We must be the ones that defeat those who would come and take our lands! We will kill them, parting their filthy heads from their vile bodies!\"</p><p>Prince Eldred nodded eagerly as they both ran toward the battlefield, he could not believe the stench of blood, faeces and sweat that filled the air yet it was mixed with something else, it was the tangible smell of fear. </p><p>Fear also gripped at his heart as he drew his beautiful sword readying himself to cleave the nearest enemy, to kill for the first time. He was hungry to prove himself to his father, he wanted his blade to taste the enemy's dirty blood.</p><p>Suddenly, a great wind whipped up around them. It was a strange wind which only affected them; the Prince through squinting eyes observed that the battle before them continued unhindered by this unearthly gust. The wind threw them around with ease lifting their feet from the ground and hurtling them back down again in an instant. Scared and confused they staggered forward towards the battle with their cloaks billowing in the great winds that tore at their bodies. The Prince began to slash out at the gusts of wind with his sword, for he believed that some kind of magic had been cast upon them by their enemy.  Prince Eldred screamed in anger and frustration as he and his father were pushed backwards by the sheer force of the winds.</p><p>A strange high pitched scream began to emanate from around them, it increased in intensity forcing them to drop their weapons and reach for their ears in a desperate attempt to try to block out the increasingly painful sound.</p><p>Even before their weapons had reached the bloodied ground, wind elementals that flashed silver and gold within the sunlight grasped at them, they held them with a steady sureness wielding them around their gleaming heads. Chanting in high pitched squeals of joy \"We are Slyph, we are Slyph, you must die!\".</p><p>With this the nearest elemental lashed out at the King with great power and speed. The King fell immediately, his head rolling down the hill in a haze of the brightest shade of crimson.  The Prince, still holding his ears, looked in disbelief as his father's head rolled and bumped down the slope towards the still raging battle. He was stunned only for a moment. As if cutting their way through a field of corn the elementals vigorously butchered the soldiers all around him, making them scream out in horror.  But these were silent screams, their mouths moved in anguish but their cries could not be heard above the  shrieking elementals. </p><p>The elementals then turned towards Prince Eldred their shapes whipping and whirling, twirling about him in gleaming patterns. He could sense they knew who he was and with a fresh burst of courage he reached for his trusty sword which had been taken by the elemental closest to his left shoulder. He somehow managed to grasp the blade which cut into his hand through his leather gauntlet as he tugged it from the iron grip of the elemental, the sword looked so beautiful as he flicked it over in one agile movement so that the handle was once again resting in his injured hand. </p><p>Before him drifting in the wind was an enormous dark coloured elemental, it stood out amongst the others due to its immense size and presence. Its face shone like a dark moon as it held outstretched a sword which resonated an immense power, a sword which possessed a blade that glowed with fire, the elemental swung it around its enormous bulbous  dark head. The Prince was mesmerised by the swords' beauty as it arced downwards with such force it slid straight through the Prince's sword like it was made from a brittle stick. The blade fell to the ground with a dull thud, leaving only its handle in his right hand. He felt almost instantaneously an excruciating pain emanating from his chest and looking down with horror, he recognised his chest was now gaping open, his breastplate in pieces and his ribs exposed. As he slowly began to comprehend what had happened to him, the elemental advanced once again, this time to finish the Prince once and for all.  But with his last remaining strength Prince Eldred managed to unveil the deadly secret which lay in his sword handle exposing the two fangs of the serpent. With all the remaining strength he could muster he plunged the fangs into the face of the grinning elemental in front of him.</p><p>A huge roar of such ferocity yet also surprise came from the great creature as its movements rapidly slowed. It began to fall, yet before it could hit the ground paralysed, the other elementals swooped around it lifting the being upwards gracefully towards the stars, rapidly disappearing in a gleaming funeral like procession towards the red star which hung above them. As it ascended the Prince saw the great sword still burning fall to the ground near to him. He was dying, but it was so beautiful, more beautiful than anything he had ever seen, even more beautiful than his own sword which was now destroyed.  He had to possess it, if even just for a moment. But as his hand reached for its hilt it slipped away from his grasp, and he then was aware of an enemy soldier standing over him. The last sensation was a slashing at his throat. With so much more blood and a huge war axe brought down on the remains of his chest, he knew no more.</p></body></html>"

    c7.content = u"<html><body><h1>ELDRED 2: YGGDRASIL </h1><p>Side by side they sat beneath the ancient tree known locally as Yggdrasil. Four young women, each one naked, their blonde hair cascading in waves down their backs, almost covering their full breasts. They gently rocked to and thro in the summer breeze.  Riding the breeze, the stench of battle, death and defeat. They stared with clear blue eyes at the gnarled branches that appeared to reach towards them with greedy and grasping intent, searching for a youth long lost.  Their faces impassive, their lips moving in unison as guttural incantations drifted from them.  Their chants grew louder and louder, their breasts heaving with passion. Leaves began to float gently down upon them momentarily covering their nakedness. Twisting and turning over and over waves of luscious green flowed. Their palms fell open, letting the leaves slowly and gently nestle.   Once their small hands were full of leaves their chanting ceased and the leaves fell no longer. </p><p> </p><p>As one, they turned away from the tree and faced together the carnage of battle.  Fields and fields of men lay dead where they fell.  The battle had ended some time ago all that now remained was a landscape of corpses, some still moving slowly, some groaning, some begging for death to release them from their broken bodies.  The women moved forward, pale faced and impassive they began slowly to weave through the mounds of bodies their hands gently caressing the rent flesh and smearing blood stained fingers upon their torsos down to the place between their legs which tingled with anticipation.  Colours resonating around them, bright tunics, standards that still fluttered in the breeze bearing standards of red and white crosses, Eagles and raging bears. </p><p>Eventually the young women arrived at their destination which lay by the side of a trickling brook. Here rested the body of the slain Prince. His handsome face still and pale, his eyes wide as if trying to take with him a last long image of the world he had been ruthlessly torn away from.  A huge axe embedded in his chest exposed his internal organs to the gaze of the women standing before him. Swiftly the four women began to place the gathered leaves upon the Prince's face and his chest which no longer rose and fell with the breath of life.  They gathered around his body and once again they began to chant, grunting and groaning with passion and ecstasy their hands, breasts and thighs rubbing against his face and chest. The leaves began to smoke and smoulder before them, small flickering flames in waves beginning to envelop the entire length of the Prince's body. His tunic was now fully a blaze with waves of flame caressing his golden locks, the flames not destroying him but restoring him.  His chest began to close, the flames cauterised his wounds, healing them with the heat of fire. His ripped throat was welded together and the sound of incoherent words flowed from his parched lips.  With these utterances the young enchantresses began to weep, their tears extinguishing the flames. When all the flames had gone and life flowed freely through his body, they brought him water from the brook, he drank greedily from their cupped hands, gulping down the clear water.   </p><p>After some time once his strength restored, the women helped Prince Eldred to his feet, he stared with disbelief at his friends and family that lay dead all around him. His heart hurt with the sight of such barbarism, and thoughts of revenge surged through him.  He arched his back screaming at the distant red star where the strange adversaries had retreated. Cursing the gods which had brought such misfortune upon him and he swore to slay the perpetrators of these evil deeds.  Several moments passed as he staggered beneath the heavy weight of grief until he realised the women were now tugging at his Emerald tunic and removing his lower garments. They began to chant louder and louder as they grasped his manhood. He gasped with a depth of intense pleasure as he entered them one after the other, his life force growing with every thrust.  Their incantations increased in volume and urgency as he reached his climax. A golden glowing orb emanated from each woman, rising from her glistening body each rapidly circled high above and plummeted down upon the Prince entering his nose and open mouth as he cried in ecstasy. His life force was fully returned. As his cries subsided silence fell like a blanket upon him.</p><p>The women beckoned to him to follow them quickly. \"Follow us\" they whispered, \"follow us to the tree of life, where your journey will truly begin, it wants to lead you to the light\" they whispered, \"to the light\".  With that they began to sing, and it was the sweetest song the Prince had ever heard, they held his hands gently and slowly together in a circle they began to rise from the ground. Spinning around together as they floated across the fields, hand in hand, high above the carnage that lay below them, they drifted back towards the dark gnarled branches of the ancient tree.   </p><p>They came to rest on one of the higher branches of the tree. The Prince staring with wide eyes in awe of the event that had just taken place. His body shaking with life and residual sexual energy, he turned to look at the four naked women before him with a renewed hunger, but to his disbelief they had risen again from the branches, but this time as pure white doves. They had transformed the moment they had touched the tree.  They circled around him looking beautiful in their flight. \"Come back\" Eldred called to them, \"Come back, who are you? I owe you my life!\" The birds ignored his pleas continuing their circling of the tree where he was perched. </p><p>Prince Eldred attempted to climb down from the tree, but his whole body appeared to be stuck to its branches, it clung to him like a desperate lover, immobilised he could not move. His heart thumped hard within him and a cold sweat seeped across his brow.  He began to shout and scream in panic, \"What infernal magic is this? I demand you release me; do you hear?\" As these last words left his lips he could feel the tree begin to shake, a violent shaking that came from somewhere deep underground, the vibrations flowing right through his body, sending bile rushing and gurgling into his throat. The ground surrounding the bottom of the tree began to stir, writhing in thick, undulating waves as the tree began an assent back into the ground out of which it had grown many, many hundreds of years before. </p><p>Down and down into the ground it withdrew, like a sword withdrawing into its sheath, as if time was reversing the tree once again returned to the state of a young sapling, but its grip remained iron strong.  The Prince's mouth fell open aghast and helpless at what was happening as his entire body slowly disappeared into the yielding, welcoming, famished ground. </p><p>He desperately screamed out to the gods to help him. Dragged by the young shoot he travelled deeper and deeper under the soil and his words soon became muffled. Quicker and quicker down and down a dank and cloying darkness all around him. He held onto his breath, keeping his mouth and eyes firmly shut as he continued his journey through the soil of his homeland. Desperate for a breath of life-sustaining air that so recently had been returned to him, he was dragged into the seed of the once ancient tree, his body was pulled with inhuman force into the darkness of the seed shell. Once it had captured its prey the seed began to seal itself, imprisoning him in an ever deeper darkness.</p><p>The Prince beat his hands hard against the insides of the seed shell, desperate for escape from the darkness that lay around him, but with no success. Dispirited, he collapsed and strangely within a matter of moments he had drifted off into a deep sleep.  </p><p>In his dream he was surrounded once again by the beautiful women who had brought him back from death, but this time they did not look so beautiful, for when their faces turned toward him, they possessed dark coloured tongues which began to grow and slide thickly from their drooling mouths.  Their tongues had taken on the form of serpents which swept to and thro before him spewing out liquid which splashed in waves against his body.  He couldn't move as the liquid covered him, it drenched him and paralysis ruled his body as the liquid seeped into him, bubbling and leaking into his very being.  After a few moments he could feel a rising with in him, suddenly a surge of something which felt like skittering bugs forcing their way out of his mouth in a spurt of darkness.   The dark skittering beings now floated about him and they had the appearance of colourful birds but each and every one of them possessed a face not unlike his own. Miserable faces, miniature caricatures of himself, mocking and sneering. He tried to back away from their mirth as it hurt his soul, but there was no escape from them as they floated and danced around him in hordes.  The women with their tongues still lolling, flicked their tongues towards these strange floating creatures capturing them on the stickiness of their tongues, pulling them into their smiling mouths, groaning and savouring as they consumed them.  With each swallowing their bodies began to grow, swelling grossly before the Prince, this was a grotesque sight which filled him with a deeper fear. Larger and larger they became until there was no room for Eldred to breathe as the fat of the young women's bodies began to suffocate him, pinning him to the wall of the seed. He tried to bite at the flesh before him but there was just too much of it, and in time he grew weak and tears stung his eyes as began to breathe his last.                  </p><p>Abruptly, deeply sobbing and gasping for breath he came out of his dream finding that there were tears spilling down his cheeks, tears for himself, tears for the fate of himself within his dream. His tears were unstoppable as they spilt down his face dripping off his chin in large globules.  After some time still weeping he began to feel something strangely shifting beneath his crumpled body, something small stirring beneath him, and with a shaking, furtive hand he groped below himself to find out what this strange object was.  It felt soft to touch and he could feel it's size ever increasing, pushing its way around his body, beginning to embrace him in its grip. His body began to actually feel like it was being lifted upwards towards the seed wall that cocooned him. He braced his arms for fear that he would be crushed against the inner shell, his arms were pressed with great force against the walls of the seed, until with an almighty crack, a surge of soil poured upon him and he was once again journeying through the ground in the embrace of the incredibly strong appendage that held him tight.  He screamed with terror as his journey through the soil sped up to a point where what remained of his clothes were literally being torn from his body. Strangely though and on an incomprehensible level he wondered to himself why he was not suffocating or being crushed beneath the sheer volume and weight of the soil. But this was only a fleeting thought and there was no answer to it, as he cut through the soil and exploded out of the ground in an eruption of debris. </p><p><hr></p><p>Prince Eldred opened his eyes and was greeted by a strange sight for everything that surrounded him was coloured red.  The soil that lay about him, the trees that swayed in the near distance and even the sky itself glowed red.  He looked down at his naked body for signs of damage from his journey, but remarkably could not see any signs of damage.  Slowly he rose to his feet and made his way to the edge of a large pit which rumbled and spat out leaping red flames from within.  At the bottom of the gaping pit he could make out a familiar form, the form of the enormous, bulbous headed elemental that he was sure he had slain with poison in battle. It lay within the red flames in all its glory.  The flames caressing the being, not destroying it, but loving its body within the red pyre. Anger bubbled up within the Prince as his mind filled with thoughts of vengeance for his friends, family and comrades who had been slain.   The Prince desperately looked around for some sort of weapon so that he could slay the monster once and for all before it awoke from its slumber. His mind was drawn to the beautiful sword, wondering what had become of this. However, the only possible weapon he could set his hands upon was a large rock stationed a few meters from the pit.  </p><p>Naked he made his way over to where the stone lay, placing his muscular arms around it. After much effort he managed to heave the rock up to the level of his belly and he began a slow staggering journey towards the pit and vengeance.  After much grunting and growling he made it at last to the rim of the pit as once again he stared down at the hideous abomination that lay below him.   Anger seethed through his body as he slowly pushed the huge rock closer to the edge and just as he was about to place all of his weight behind a final push of the rock a high pitched voice emanated from above him 'Stop Prince, why would you want to murder your brother?' </p><p>These very words froze Prince Eldred in his tracks.  After several moments of contemplation, the Prince lifted his head and looked up at the speaker of these words.  Above him hovered one elemental, a small one at that, probably only the size of a mere grasshopper.  It floated above him glimmering, in its hand it held a tiny sword, which must not have been much heftier than a match stick.   \"Prince, he is your brother, I can prove this to you, follow me.\" The Prince stared at the elemental aghast by this ludicrous notion. \"Be gone or you will die also, he will be slain he murdered my people, my people, do you hear me, and now he will die!\" roared the Prince. </p><p>'Stop!' the elemental spoke again, much more forcefully this time 'I will tell you more'.  'You belong to us now, you are our kin, your wives and blood children they await you'   The Prince fell backwards away from the pit due to the sheer power of these spoken words.  \"No, this cannot be, you lie!\" Shouted the Prince. \"Well, let me show you then, just follow me, and I will prove to you the very justness of my words\" </p><p>Begrudgingly, leaving the rock perched at the side of the pit the Prince in a state of disbelief due to the unholy words spoken by the elemental began to follow its twirling and fluttering flight path away from the side of the pit. </p><p>After scaling steep rouge coloured slopes for what seemed like an age, they arrived at the entrance of a cave which hummed with activity emanating from deep within its glowing red interior. \"Prince, I can go no further, for this is the Cavern of the Royals, and I must not enter this  domain, here your family awaits you!\" With these parting words the elemental disappeared in the blink of an eye leaving the Prince standing naked and alone at the very entrance of the cave.  </p><p>Prince Eldred still disbelieving the elemental, slowly entered into the cave, his body appeared to gleam with bright scarlet.   </p><p>Fearing that he had been led into a cunning trap, the Prince found a sharp stick nearby, not a glorious sword, but still a handy weapon he grasped it tightly in his hand wishing that he had somehow managed to keep hold of the beautiful sword, but it was lost.   Gingerly he followed the humming which seemed to emanate from somewhere deep within the bowels of the cave, sweat dampened his hands and his breathing became deeper and more laboured as he prepared himself for some kind of assault from whatever lived within the cave. </p><p>After sometime though, there was still no assault forthcoming and the Prince became more focussed on where the humming was emanating from. After a few moments he reached a small tunnel that branched off from the open part of the cave he was now in. As he entered the passage he realised that the humming was definitely coming from within as it was becoming much louder.  The tunnel was really narrow in places and the Prince had to squeeze his way through, painfully scraping skin from his naked body.  This became an arduous task physically and psychologically for the Prince as more and more thoughts skipped through his mind regarding what he would find waiting at the end of the tunnel?  Was the elemental lying? Was this a trap? What was awaiting him? One thing was for sure the Prince would show his bravery, he would not be seen as a coward and he would face his assailants, he would destroy them and then return to the pit to seek vengeance. He would kill them all with his bare hands.  </p><p>Eventually, there was a steady change in the light ahead, from a dull red glow to once again a brighter blood red as he approached which could only be the end of the tunnel.  As he stepped out of the tunnel he grasped hard onto the sharp stick ready for any sudden attack, but once again no attack took place as he moved into the open space before him.    </p><p>The Prince abruptly stopped in his tracks, he was stunned by the sight that lay ahead and a cold shiver ran through his entire body.  He had never felt fear and confusion like he was feeling now, his brain struggling to understand and process what lay in the deep cavern before him.   Lines upon lines of small gleaming elementals filled the cavern from one side to the other all of them facing away from him towards three ruby bevelled thrones which stood side by side on an incline close to the far wall of the cave.  Their wings humming gently in unison.</p><p>He could not move, he could only stare in disbelief as three larger elementals took their places on the thrones. In a place deep within his being he suddenly understood all that had gone before, not consciously but somewhere on an innate level he got it, he now understood every twist and turn of the last few days and it sickened him.</p><p>For he had been tricked into mating with the three hideous elementals that now sat before him, the three who had previously masqueraded as lifesaving angels and shone with a pure beauty now gleamed only with a dark evil.  They had brought him back from death for only one reason, and that reason was to breed, to help sire a new royal race a race of half human half elemental, evidence of which was now lined up in row upon row before him.                   </p><p>Open mouthed and weeping uncontrollably, he fell to his knees, sobs bursting from him echoing and mixing with the gentle humming sounds that came from his spawn.   </p><p>All of a sudden as if disturbed and agitated by his sobs one by one they turned to face him.  </p><p>Hundreds upon hundreds of faces just like his own now stared upon him, smaller and rounder in shape with lolling tongues, they slowly began to unfurl their amber wings more fully and the humming sound grew louder as they readied themselves for flight.  </p><p>\"Attack!\" the three Queens shouted in unison, the spawn of the Prince as one great force now began to fly towards their father, they wanted only to butcher him, destroy him, for he was not of their kind and his job had been done. His royal blood now pumped around their tiny bodies. For they were a new more powerful race, a race far, far more superior than before. After the Prince had been butchered they would return to King Slyph, and they would lift him from his resting place in the red pyre, so that he could lead them back into battle, and this time it would be a battle that they would surely win.  For this time, it was not purely to capture a city but to conquer the entire country. For the weak little humans would fall to their knees and be humbled by a new more powerful race of the long forgotten crimson land of Slyph. </p></body></html>"

Milky moonlight peeks through, washes over the monstrous scene. The wind this night whispers of brave knights, who fight menacing, bloodthirsty eaters of human flesh on far-flung foreign lands.</p><p>Crusaders, killers of the beasts of Dagon, these gallant, lionhearted, super-beings ride on the tumultuous, sea-like night skies. Many a glowing apparition they cut down with gleaming swords, for they fear no one and nothing. Swiftly they ride on strong sky-horses, whose manes of fire flap like flags in the desperate breaths of a dying, now insane, corrupted land. A land once of a virgin innocence, now defiled and bloodied. A land now wishing and waiting for its ultimate demise. A land that now weeps rivers of bloody tears.</p><p>Far below these courageous knights live Hags, who howl at the skies, spewing fountains of ice at these great warriors in hopes of turning them into frigid, gleaming statues, which they can then mock and smash into nothingness with their rotting fists, for they constantly pray for the knights' deaths and the death of this stinking, exhausted, ugly planet that lies beneath their decaying feet.</p><p>At night, while they wallow in aqua pools of gummy-like mucus cocoons, they fantasise of their dark leader, and they wish and wish to lie beside him, where they can suck like hungry babies at his inky, trickling source of power, which leaks from his suppurating wounds. And in the morning, they are stronger, more victorious thanks to their dark lord's gift.</p><p>But woe the Angels on this land named Perthia, the angels whose only protectors are the gallant knights for whom the unholy hags seek to remove for all eternity. But woe the angels, the angels will now live a life of ultimate fear.</p><p>For this is what many a wise, ancient hag has spoken of - they would find their nirvana, a fresh gorgeous land, where they will grow and rear their young, weaning them on the collected, sticky blood of innocent angels.

She hated his narrow minded views regarding the way a Princess should behave.  Unfortunately, as far as Freyja was concerned she was never going to change her ways, certainly not to suit his whims and stupid ideologies. </p><p>      </p><p>Princess Freyja would best be described as being tom-boyish to the enth degree.  She liked to climb trees, she liked to fight and drink with the men of the realm. Basically, she enjoyed all that your ordinary male of the empire of Shalia would enjoy. With shoulder length brown hair and sharp features and a distinctly muscular build she could easily be misidentified as one of the regular fighting soldiers of the King's realm. Even the clothes she wore were not that of a Princess but that of a Prince.</p><p>Anyway, she thought to herself it will not be too long now until at last I can escape from this retched Kingdom and set forth on the amazing adventure of which I have been promised. </p><p>Sick of being stifled in the role of Princess she had secretly called forth many of the Kingdoms' finest sorcerers to help on her quest for freedom and adventure, and fortunately for Freyja they had been all too willing to help. Within days they had informed her that on their spiritual journeys they had gathered much information regarding the future of the Princess. </p><p>She was told that a great adventure including that of everlasting wealth and the love of a great Prince lay before her. But firstly she would have to travel to a place known as the 'otherworld' where eventually she would find the gates that would lead her to the Prince's realm in a place called the underworld. This journey she was warned would be a mighty challenge in itself which could possibly spell her very demise.  </p><p>The sorcerers advised her that this was the only route and that it truly was a dangerous route to take but the only option. This filled the Princess with a trembling fear but also with that of a spine tingling excitement which soon overwhelmed and battered into submission her initial fearful feelings.</p><p>She had dreamt of this Prince many times, and she had fallen deeply in love with the idea of him, regardless of never even meeting him in the flesh.  She knew he existed and if it took risking her life to attain him and his everlasting wealth then she would take the risk.</p><p>The sorcerers had briefed her on the ritual which would assist her on her journey and she was now ready and waiting for the first soft beat of the drum which she hoped with all her heart would signify her first steps to love and freedom. And sure enough as the sorcerer's had advised as the beat progressed she slowly felt herself spiritually slipping out of her body.  She felt herself floating like a feather around the room, delicately, hither and thither as if drifting on the very beat and reverberations of the drum which filled her senses to the brim.  </p><p>Below her she could see her prone body and the serious grey faces of the three sorcerers that surrounded her but this meant nothing to her as she swiftly swept up and up through the Castle itself. Floor after floor she passed through and her overall awareness was now acute, her sight impeccable as she picked out the minute detail around her absorbing it all into her spirit body, she had never felt so alive. </p><p>Up and up, travelling now at the speed of light she floated rapidly away from the castle towards the crimson skies that to her appeared pregnant with blood.</p><p>Whooping with delight she spotted a small glimmering apricot coloured gash in the belly of the crimson clouds, this must be the path she thought to herself as she headed toward the gap that lay before her.  As she entered it opened up, a tunnel of light that swirled around and round, up and down until at last she gently alighted into a lush, green forest she believed the sorcerer's had named, the 'otherworld'.  </p><p>The sorcerer had advised her at this point to look for the access points to the other realms in which she could begin to look for clues that would help her find the 'glorious gates' and then penetrate them to hopefully locate the Prince of her dreams in the underworld.</p><p>So with a mixture of fear and astonishment Princess Frejya started to explore this beautiful but strange 'otherworld'.</p><p>All around her lay dark branches which she felt in an odd way were reaching out for her with gnarled fingers, grasping greedily at her flesh. These were nothing like the forests of Shalia and the sorcerers had indeed warned her that she would come across such strange phenomenon in these new worlds. </p><p>After several minutes of battling through branches and thick undergrowth she came to a clearing, in the centre of which lay a small pond of glimmering water.  The water gently reflected the apricot sky from which Freyja some time ago descended.  </p><p>She stared down into the water and felt a strange pulling feeling, the sorcerers had told her to follow her feelings as these would help guide her to attain the keys of her journey between worlds, so she bent forwards towards the water, resisting the temptation to flee from this new peculiar sensation.   </p><p>Slowly she lowered her head into the water and it was warm around her face.  Strangely she felt the urge to let the water begin to gush into her open mouth, she felt no need to close it, so she just let the water rush in. She felt the water pouring down her throat and into her belly filling her full with its warmth. It was a glorious feeling of heat that flooded into her. </p><p>After several moments her mouth closed involuntarily, and she fell backwards, gently onto a soft bed of moss which surrounded the pond. Staring up at the apricot skies she felt immobilised, her mind in a drug-like state she felt only pleasure.  </p><p>Incapacitated by the strange potency of the water she had consumed, her eyes slowly and blearily, fixed upon a legion of small black spots which were in the very centre of the apricot sky. Black spots which seemed to grow bigger by the second until they spanned across the entire breadth of the sky. Lines and lines hurtling towards her vulnerable body.</p><p>Closer and closer they came, bringing huge gusts of wind and debris with them.  Their bodies once in view were that of an elongated shape, each one being a dark shade of green. They possessed feathered wings on either side of their snake like bodies, which enabled them to be rapidly propelled forward. Their faces were rounded, bloated, and a bright shade of red, and in the centre of each of these grotesque faces, just above their lolling, drooling tongues, lay sharp, protruding, spiky appendages. </p><p>   </p><p>At the sight of this terrifying siege, Freyja's body began to buck and writhe on the ground, as if possessed she began to froth at the mouth and deep guttural words then  emanated from somewhere deep inside her, not her own words, but those of another spoke forth. \"Breathe child, breathe, breathe upon the beasts before thee, let the great dragon within thee breathe forth\"; with these commands resonating within her she let out a huge gasp and the warm water that previously lay within her belly, burst out of her in streams of flame directly at the descending beasts. The beasts quickly attempted to avoid the flames desperate to impale their prey but with little success, as the flames formed a wall of fire around Freyja's entire body, protecting her from the thrusting, spikey appendages. One by one the beasts burst into flames, howling and squealing in agony as they were consumed in fire. Their dying bodies now littered the forest which surrounded Freyja's spirit-body, the trees themselves beginning to catch fire from the conflagration of the beasts. Some of them had their wings burnt from them but successfully slithered off into holes which they had frantically dug with their appendages, burying themselves from sight. The remaining few took flight shrieking and screaming to get away from the scene of carnage and back into the safety of the apricot sky.   </p></body></html>"

    c10.content =u"<html><body><h1>FREJA 2: A FACE OF STONE</h1><p>Within the realms of the great castle the beat of the drum ceased and silence reigned within the scarcely lit room.  Only the shallow breathing of the three sorcerers could be heard, but only faintly.  </p><p>The smallest, but only in physical stature, of the sorcerers Abujo, then spoke out. \"It is done brothers, our duty is done and now we should visit Stoneface and demand  our reward.\" The other two solemnly nodded their agreement, \"Yes, as promised we should deliver her vulnerable flesh to the master, the place of everlasting peace, for she has left this world for another and her shell is no longer of use to her and we promised the great one we would deliver her royal body as a sacrifice.\"</p><p>The Princess' body lay as still as a rock, her face as pale as snow, her hair spilling down in gentle waves covering parts of her delicate countenance.</p><p>The sorcerers gently manipulated her cold body into a scratchy hessian sack the top of which they tied a lose knot.  Gently the largest of the sorcerers named Gabada lifted the sack onto his broad shoulders, as the other two helped him towards the narrow doorway which led to a dimly lit flight of stairs.</p><p>Once the sorcerers had negotiated the short vestibule of steps, they entered silently and slowly into the hidden passage way of which only they and the Princess were aware. </p><p>The passage way travelled under a small section of the Castle and then secretly opened up into subterranean caves which lead after a few yards into the dense forest of Shalia.</p><p>Habindo, the third of the sorcerers grinned to himself as they made their way through the darkness of the passage way.  \"The master will be proud of us,\" he gloated;  \"everlasting life will surely be ours\".  The other two nodded in agreement, their faces shining with pleasure and perspiration. The dreadful deed they had committed was going exactly to plan. For they had tricked the Princess purely for the needs of their rather sinister master, 'Stoneface' who now lay in wait for their arrival in the forest. The sorcerers had been promised fair exchange, for a gargantuan reward of immortality.</p><p>It was many moons ago that Abujo had been awoken by the flame spirits.  He thought of them now, their pure beauty, their heat and their great healing power. He recalled the way in which they had danced around his naked prone body, entering him with their fiery tongues cleansing him, planting their message deep within his brain.  \"Bring me the Princess Freyja, I need her, for my lust is overwhelming, bring me the Princess and you and your brothers will be justly rewarded with the paradise of immortality\". </p><p>Abujo remembered how he felt when he heard these words, they filled him with excitement; for immortality had always been something he had dreamt of and yet even his great magical powers could not secure such a gift. </p><p>He remembered then how the flames had rushed out of his prone body and formed a line of fire which led from of his cabin deep into the forest.  He had followed the flame spirits as they burnt a winding trail through the woods.</p><p>Eventually the spirits had led him to a clearing in the forest where the leaves were piled high.  The spirits then set about burning away the leaves, he remembered strongly the strange scents that had filled his senses to overflowing. After a few moments of steady burning he remembered his sense of awe when a stone face was unveiled before his eyes. The stone effigy lay embedded within the soil, unmistakably a face which stared forth towards the heavens with dead, unseeing eyes. But the strangest part was yet to come as the spirit flames gathered around the face and slowly seeped into its stone mouth.  </p><p>Once the flames had completely disappeared, the face gained more elasticity, and Abujo recalled how it had coughed and spluttered for a moment or two before it spoke gently to him. \"Bring me Princess Frejya, feed me her empty shell and with your cunning send her spirit to journey to the other side, where there will be no return. Immortality I will grant you, so go now, make haste for Stoneface is hungry!\" it roared malevolently!</p><p>Their plans had been cunning and more importantly their plans had been successful, lies of love and wealth and greatness had been fed to the Princess on several occasions and she had gobbled them down into her hungry gullible heart.  And now this, Abujo  and his comrades made their way towards the place where Stoneface was waiting silently within the soil of the woods of Shalia to provide them with their long-desired reward of immortality. </p><p>There was a large full blood-red moon and the air was fresh pregnant with expectation, as the sorcerers huddled close together for warmth as they gingerly made their way through the woods.  Beasts moved around within the undergrowth and Abujo had to use his magical powers to craft a shield of safety around them, but on odd occasions, the Synomite beasts managed to wriggle through the shield with their slender small bodies, but only to be stamped on and popped with a spray of fine mist by the powerful feet of Gabada. The Synomites were blood sucking parasites that wriggled with speed and clamped themselves with their short sharp fangs onto any succulent piece of flesh they could get a hold of, where they would suck the blood from their prey with their incredibly powerful suckers that lay precisely placed above their protruding fangs.  Gabada was especially effective at keeping these parasites at bay, much more so than his two older but more feeble comrades.</p><p>Eventually, they arrived at the clearing which was brightly lit by the red moon.  A milky light fell upon the silent Stoneface. With a grunt Gabada gently placed the Princess' body to the ground in its hessian sack and all three of them stared in silence at Stoneface, waiting with nervous anticipation for any sign of life.    </p><p>They did not have to wait for too long; as small rumbling sounds began to emanate from Stoneface's mouth. </p><p>Abujo was the only one who had seen Stoneface speak before; the other two were so shocked by the sounds coming forth from the piece of stone shaped as a grotesque face, that their mouths fell open aghast.</p><p>\"Link hands around my face brothers and immortality will be yours, but firstly bring me my gift!\"</p><p>Eventhough he was in total awe of Stoneface Abujo was a wise sorcerer and not yet completely sure he could trust the strange phenomenon that lay before him. So he spoke out in a shaking voice, \"Master, firstly grant us immortality as you promised and then we shall give you our gift\". Stoneface grumbled inaudibly to himself when he heard these words and after a short time he spoke out again, \"if that be your wish sorcerer, come to me now, stand around me, link your arms and immortality will be yours. But first, at least give me a glimpse of my gift\". </p><p>Abujo nodded to Gabada, and with magical gestures, Gabada began to drag the sack containing the Princess over towards Stoneface. Stoneface began to shake as the bag was moved closer to him; the ground around him began to vibrate and gently undulate with the power of his movements. \"Show me\" he said to Gabada. Gabada turned to Abujo awaiting further instruction but none came. Abujo once again spoke out, \"Master we will show you once we have been given our reward\". </p><p>\"So be it\" said Stoneface in an angry tone. \"Come to me then and you will receive your payment.\"</p><p>The body of the Princess was now only a short distance from the stone effigy; the three sorcerers made their way with shaking excitement towards the solemn looking Stoneface. They slowly linked their arms around him, their hands shaking as they did so, their eyes staring down awaiting their gift of immortality as promised. At first, there was nothing more than a cold silence that emanated forth from Stoneface; then all of a sudden his mouth-gaping wide as a huge sucking force came from between his lips. </p><p>The three sorcerers screamed out in fear and terror as they tried to move themselves away from now gaping maw of Stoneface; they were rapidly being pulled and sucked down towards his open mouth. They could not resist this enormous power of suction as it forced them to their knees.</p><p>\"Pray to me you retches!\" Stoneface screamed forth \"Pray!\"</p><p>The sorcerers shouted weakening incantations to Stoneface begging him to release them from this vortex; but instead, the sucking increased and they were dragged one by one into its rocky mouth.</p><p>Cracking bones and high pitched screams of the sorcerers could be heard throughout the woods of Shalia as Stoneface ground them into dust. After many minutes only silence reigned, once again serenity prevails. </p><p> </p></body></html>"

And like a babe, I wrapped myself within its dark embrace, nuzzling gladly at its icy breast, seeking that familiar sticky, dark fluid, which oozed like a fine wine from within it. Shortly after quenching my thirst, I became drowsy, as if in a drug-induced, dream-like state, and flashes of crimson, orange, and mauve streamed about me in waves.</p><p>Voices, both high-pitched and low guttural, reverberated around me, all chanting, in unison, two words, over and over again: \"White worm. White worm. White worm. White worm...\" After some time, a new phrase sounded, \"White worm is within thee.\" Then, a deathly silence fell.</p><p>I sank to my knees, and with my hands, I dug at the rocks possessed, unable to draw a halt to my crazed actions. My flesh ripped from my bones in bloody chunks of gore, but I felt no pain. In fact, I chuckled to myself hysterically as the blood poured and spurted from my mutilated fingers.</p><p>After a short time of this frenzied activity, obviously having had no impact whatsoever on the solid granite rocks that I pounded so furiously, only my bones remained. They cracked and splintered on impact as still I incessantly scrabbled at the rocks covered in pools of my congealing, sticky blood. On and on this insanity went as my arms slowly disintegrated before my disbelieving, shocked eyes. Now I was up to my elbows, and still no sign of relenting. Until after what seemed like hours, my arms were no more, and as abruptly as this madness had started, it ceased. Still feeling possessed by some otherworldly force, I sank onto my belly and rived, my body slipping along the rocks with flexibility I never knew I possessed.</p><p>Like a hammer blow to my head, I suddenly realised I was now born again as a white worm, and looking horrifyingly at my skin, I could see it shone with a scaly, milk-white pallor. I screamed at the darkness, but no sound came from my mouth, which had now transformed into a slit within my flat, white head.</p><p>My body with great speed and agility, darted, without my control, into the darkness of the bowels of my new home, deep within the legendary mountains of madness, where I would lie in wait, for the coming of the wizards, of whom I would consume most heartily.</p></body></html>"

    c20.content =u"<html><body><h1>BLIND PANIC</h1><p>Lying on my back I wonder where I am. My body is heavy with sleep but strangely my mind has woken. I'm conscious, my bed is hard as a butcher's block and my bedroom unnaturally stuffy, I blink slowly and deliberately in an attempt to clear the heavy funk from my mind. It's so dark there's no sound from the cobbled street outside, the silence is distinctly palpable. I wonder what time it is. I turn my head to look for the bedroom wall clock but I can see and hear nothing, I rack my brain for an explanation but none appears. My mouth is so dry, what did I do last night? Snippets of somehow distant memories drift through my mind but nothing seems to make sense, nothing connects.  I turn my head toward my sleeping wife and quietly murmur \"I'm just getting a drink of water, back in a moment.\" I start to sit up and immediately THWACK! \"ARGHHH!\" I bump my head on an unseen object immediately above my face, my cry somehow muffled. Blood  oozing from my broken nose, anxiety grips my chest. I cannot breathe...</p><p><hr> </p><p>I explore the space immediately above my face, my fingertips greeted with the feel of polished wood. I call to my wife lying beside me, but no reply. I frantically search for her groping out to my right and my left, my fingers greeted again with richly polished wood this time through padded cloth. I kick my feet trying to explore below they find the same. I struggle to take a deep breath trying to fathom what is happening, I start screaming and shouting calling for my wife calling for anyone who could hear me! But all I could hear was the heavy sound of silence. I tried to think of what happened the previous day that may explain where I am now, fragments of memories disconnected; one though sticks in my mind, I remember my wife crying over me, I desperately try to remember why but the memories remain elusive. My heart beats faster and faster, I am shaking violently blood from my nose seeping into my mouth choking me.</p><p>\"Where am I? Why am I here...?!\"</p><p>I try to think back for any clue, my mind hurts with the strain, I feel as if I slept for years. My eyes are dry, tears do not come, the feeling of claustrophobia is suffocating. There is little air, breathing is getting difficult, I am robbed of air my tongue too big for my mouth. Now I remember. Fragmented memories drift into view of being surrounded by doctor and nurses I remember being very ill my wife weeping her goodbye, I remember the icy grip of Death its suffocating fingers stealing my life's breath. I remember.</p><p>I realise where I am and start to claw at the coffin lid. Splinters lodge under my fingernails, I smell fresh blood. I kick at the lid hoping somehow to break free, but it does no good. I am screaming and shouting my very life depends upon it, I scream for my wife, begging for her to find me! My voice cracking growing quiet, the silence is deafening, breathing such an effort, harder and harder. Every breath a desperate attempt to cling to life.</p><p>My mind wanders and I start to dream no longer constrained by my grave, I float gently upwards through the ground, I notice my headstone 'Harry Rolting', yes that's right once I had been Harry. I dream of blue skies and open flower filled meadows. I see my wife and children far away calling to me in the distance, I am gently flying through the air. I reach my wife, my family I throw my arms around them. I hold them in my thoughts as my dream starts to fade, I stop breathing, I die a second death.</p></body></html>"

They dug ferociously, with an abnormal strength that no bird should ever be able to possess, some of their thin necks cracking and snapping like dry twigs as they thrust and thrust, deeper and deeper toward the buried corpse of Icha the Wizard. For this was the prize they sought so desperately, they sought to unearth the dead wizard's body and then to carry it high over the mountains and fields to the place where Elevefron the Wizard, their master, Icha's enemy in life, did wait.</p><p>The birds, after many deaths of their own, finally reached the box that contained Icha. They pulled and pulled, and the lid on his coffin slowly, with great effort, creaked open to reveal Icha still clad in his beautiful, breathtaking wizard's robe of crimson satin. At this sight, all the birds, in a mad frenzy, flew into the darkness of the grave, and they smothered Icha, for during his life they had despised his evil wizardry.</p><p>But to their surprise and horror, from Icha's rotting, gaping mouth, a deformed, two-headed, feline-like creature did emerge to meet them, and furthermore, to bring their terror to an ultimate crescendo. The coffin lid slammed shut with an unerring force and trapped the whole mass of now doomed, terrified blackbirds within the darkness of Icha's grave.</p><p>Much later, a partial silence did reign in the dark graveyard, apart only from the spasmodic, hysterical, whooping laughter, which drifted from the dark grave of Icha the Wizard as he and his two-headed feline friend fed most heartily upon the dead, defeated blackbirds.</p></body></html>"

Deep down, cloaked by darkness, the ancient worm will never grow hungry. Slipping and sliding, gliding powerfully, it searches for the delicacy of the lost, desperate soul howling somewhere far below, in amongst the shadowy catacombs of the graveyard of Gomara. Now dead, but still suffering deeply, the soul of a small, lonely child weeps and howls for the return of life or for the soft, warm love of a parent, but unfortunately, neither of these will be found for the bloated, blubbery, great white worm has this soul's scent engraved deeply within its brilliant mind. The taste of a fresh soul to the white, soul-hunting worm is unsurpassable.</p><p>Hours later, beneath the old, broken-down church, lying in the bowels of Gomara, the great white worm is full and content. Coiled at the feet of its dark master, the worm dreams, and the dark one feeds off these dreams, which are laced with fear, pain, and loneliness--fine sustenance, for the dark god of Gomara, fine indeed.</p><p>In the milky moonlight, moving stealthily amidst the stripped, skeletal trees, hordes of fiery demons lurk. Glowing, like orange-red wisps of fire, they search for the one who has been reborn, for the one who has lived amongst them like one of them for many a year. The one of great disguise. The one named the head hunting beast by many a foe. The one who is silence. The one who is as dark as the deepest night. The one, who is death itself, must be hunted down, slain, laid low as an impostor, a cheat, a fraud.</p><p>The one named Demigog must drown in a river of his own blood.</p><p>Alone that night, Demigog prays to his new gods, the gods who tamed his wicked side during one of his deepest dreams and then returneth him changed in mind and body. In this deep, coma-like dream, he had squinted through the brightest of lights and saw things that filled his heart with exultation, lifted his spirits high, so that he could fly with the ravens of the night and visit the many temples that lie to the south far away and which are sacred to all.</p><p>It is said, in these temples, many a great, fearsome beast has been laid to rest by the icy stare of one of the ancient temples' fair guardians, and it was these same fair guardians who have now tamed the great, once merciless one, who is now as harmless as the sacrificial lamb.</p><p>But of all this, he knows. He also knows his one-time friends, the evil others, will never understand. They cannot and will not ever believe the story of his dream--so now he prays with all of his might, he seeks the help of the dream guardians to slay his once friends, now enemies, just by the stare of his own crimson eyes--the miraculous stare is what he seeks.</p><p>But nowhere amongst his prayers can this miracle be retrieved. The only place it can ever be found again is within Demigog's deep, dream world, which lies buried within his subconscious. So now he must sleep, and he will talk, and reason, with the guardians, and he will, he must, return with the secret of the stare.</p><p>Or, without any doubt, he will be slaughtered.</p></body></html>"

Their strong grimy roots sucked and sucked at the bloodless, entangled corpses that lay about them in piles, for victory was now theirs.</p><p>Their petals grew fleshier, bright red in colour, and they slowly took on the very appearance of the faces of their grimacing victims, who they had drained dry of all life-giving blood. The eerie echo of the dying moans and screams of the slain humans, now emanated from the flowers themselves, and their petals and stems throbbed gently to a slow, strong internal rhythm.</p><p>Demon flowers now covered the ruined temples, pyramids, and shrines of this ancient land in a glorious, luscious scarlet. They had virtually smothered the whole land in a spectacular, breathtaking tidal wave of crimson.</p><p>The humanoid dead now sprouted these flowers from every orifice: the flowers grew from empty eye sockets and from gaping, silently screaming mouths.</p><p>The flowers had conquered the humanoids, and now they would thrive. They would sing their ancient songs and wish and wait patiently for the resurrection of their dark master.</p><p>However, some of them did feel remorse for the pitiful, stupid humans, for the flowers had been nurtured and, to a certain extent, looked after quite well by the creatures, but water alone was no sustenance for the demon flower--blood was what they had always sought, and now they had drunk that precious liquid in quantity.</p><p>This was the first of the distant lands they planned to conquer. Soon, more and more planets would fall to the demon flower, and the new lands soon would be submerged within a mass of bloody-coloured demon flowers.</p></body></html>"

Animals, this night, stand statue-like, struck dumb with fear.</p><p>The trees, they whisper of naked devils that dance around them in the deep of the night, devils that sing and rejoice and then enter a coma-like sleep for hour upon hour.</p><p>But what the ancient trees did not behold, that which is, as yet, hidden from all reality, is the activity going on within the demons' cesspool minds. They wallow in lakes of crimson blood, and slowly emerging from these lakes of blood, like a phoenix rising out of the ashes before them, a huge, horned god, who breathes streams and great gouts of fire into which the devils shriek and drool, immersing themselves within the beautiful pain of the flames, which lap and lick.</p><p>Aroused now, massively stimulated by the arrival of their horned god, their dreams grow fleshy, real, bubbling, gushing, out of their nostrils, out of their open mouths--spouting replicas of the great horned god.</p><p>Hundreds upon hundreds of winged devils glide effortlessly through the deep, dark Forests of the Screaming Hawk. Devils born from the dreams of devils, they wreak havoc. The good gods, far above the swirling clouds, stare at the scene, and stare through misty eyes clouded with tears, through sad, normally laughing eyes, for they know the longest night of Planet Earth has arrived with a vengeance.</p><p>A new Night Land has been born, for the flying multitudes of devils, like parasites, have surrounded the sun. They greedily feed off and then extinguish the solar flames, thus permanently sending Planet Earth into total and complete, umbra darkness.</p><p>Night Land, oh Night Land, now reigns forever.</p></body></html>"
